    "### *Leveraging Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Practice in Computer-Based Assessments*\n",
    "This notebook builds multiple **recommender systems** based on **six different collaboartive filtering (CF) techniques** and compares these models against each other based on their performance on a dataset containing student performance data (i.e., a dataset containing the scores of students on assessment questions). Our chosen CF models include **three latent factor-based models** (Singular Value Decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition Plus, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) and **three neighborhood-based models** (k-Nearest Neighbors, k-Nearest Neighbors with Means, k-Nearest Neighbors with Z-Scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether CF-based recommender systems can effectively predict students' performance scores on new, unseen questions based on their past performance, this notebook conducts **[Dietterich's 5x2 CV paired t-test](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9744903/)** on each model. We compare the models across two metrics, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, using two different datasets. For each model, we computed the average MAE and RMSE values from the 10 trials of the 5x2 CV process. To assess the statistical significance of the performance differences between each CF model and the baseline, we perform **two-sided paired t-tests** and calculate **Bonferroni-corrected p-values**, along with **Cohen's d** to measure effect sizes.
